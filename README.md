### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
  Yes, the four labs prepared me to complete the assignment. Especially lab 3 and 4 which introduced flexbox and made styling in CSS easier. I felt like I was a little unprepared to use media queries and formatting for mobile. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have like to add more features like a "Traditional Recipes" page and hover features to enhance the user experience. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I loved presneting to others, hearing their feedback, and also learning about other's projects.
